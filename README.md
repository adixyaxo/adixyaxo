## 🚀 **Who Am I?**

I am an AI/ML-focused Computer Science Engineering Undergrad who blends advanced computational thinking with clean, minimal product design. My work explores the intersection of **deep learning**, **mathematical modeling**, and **human-centered system design**. I build intelligent systems that feel precise, intentional, and structurally elegant — philosophy of simplicity with depth.

I specialize in crafting:

* Machine learning systems that reason, adapt, and generalize
* AI-powered productivity and automation frameworks
* Mathematical and algorithmic backbones for intelligent software
* High-performance backend architectures for scalable AI

## 🧠 **My Core Strengths**

* Strong foundations in **machine learning**, **neural networks**, and **applied AI**
* High-level understanding of **calculus**, **linear algebra**, **probability**, and **optimization**
* Conceptual and applied knowledge in **quantum physics**
* Ability to translate complex math into elegant, efficient systems
* Clean, intentional design aligned with functional clarity
* Rapid cross-domain learning and articulate technical communication

## 🍏 **Design Ethos — Minimalism**

> *“Elegance is not the abundance of simplicity. It is the absence of noise.”*

I build experiences that feel **quiet**, **refined**, and **meaningful** — prioritizing clarity, sense of space, and functional depth.
